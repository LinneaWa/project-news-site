# News Site

The assignment is to make a news site with a navbar, headline news and smaller news cards. The site should be responsive with mobile first and specific changes for tablet and desktop. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

With this being my first assignment to figure out on my own how to achieve the desired result I was a bit lost in the beginning and have probably made everything far more complicated than it need to be. But I desided to start with the grid and the small news-section. I made a grid and realised as I was building how I needed to make changes in the html in order to be able to style it in css as I wanted. I felt it was pretty basic to get all the newsboxes where I wanted them and the changes I wanted to happen when going between mobile, tablet and desktop. However I got stuck trying to style the text and images inside the boxes. I felt really confused until I at last realised I could use both grid and flexbox. I still have a really hard time figuring out where (parent or child) I should write the different selectors or properties. I ended up using flexbox on navbar, big news and small news. And in small news I used flexbox and grid combined. 
If I had more time I would like to continue working with the navbar. Both making it look better responsive and have a nicelooking, working menu.
