# News Site

The assignment is to make a news site with a navbar, headline news and smaller news cards. The site should be responsive with mobile first and specific changes for tablet and desktop. 

## The problem

With this being my first assignment to figure out on my own how to achieve the desired result I was a bit lost in the beginning and have probably made everything far more complicated than it need to be. But I desided to start with the grid and the small news-section. I made a grid and realised as I was building how I needed to make changes in the html in order to be able to style it in css as I wanted. I felt it was pretty basic to get all the newsboxes where I wanted them and the changes I wanted to happen when going between mobile, tablet and desktop. However I got stuck trying to style the text and images inside the boxes. I felt really confused until I at last realised I could use both grid and flexbox. I still have a really hard time figuring out where (parent or child) I should write the different selectors or properties. I ended up using flexbox on navbar, big news and small news. And in small news I used flexbox and grid combined. 
If I had more time I would like to continue working with the navbar. Both making it look better responsive and have a nicelooking, working menu.
